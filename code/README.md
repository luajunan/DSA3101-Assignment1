How to run the Colabs:

1. For the LoanDefault.ipynb, upload the cleaned dataset file “new_df_test.csv” onto Google Colab instead of the full dataset because some cleaning has been done.
2. For the EDA.ipynb. The cleaning was done on the RAW dataset. To run it, upload “application_data.csv”. The "application_data.csv" can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/arkapravasen/bank-loan-default?select=application_data.csv.
3. Run the Colabs as per usual. “Runtime” -> “Run All”.
4. Note that certain cells may take longer than usual to run due to the large dataset. (eg. Cross-validation and Calculation of Credit Scores)
